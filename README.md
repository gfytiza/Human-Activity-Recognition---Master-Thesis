# Human-Activity-Recognition---Master-Thesis

This repository contains a basic data analysis on UCI HAR dataset and the basic models that were proposed in the present thsesis. The training of the models does not present in the current file.

# Basic architecture
The hyperparameters that changed in order to optimize the accuracy score of our basic RNN, LSTM, GRU architectures were:
